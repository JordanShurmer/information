# Abstract 
This document is an in-progress proposal which is not currently in effect. It describes how decision-making within the Solid project might work. Importantly, the Solid Leader needs to approve any decision making processes for it to be legitimate and the Solid Leader can block decisions at any point.

# Purpose
There are several converstaions happening via pull requests and issues around the Solid specification. Some of these conversations date back to 2015 and there is a range of complexity and degrees of agreement. The Solid project has been worked on by multiple changing teams who each had slightly different ways of coming to consensus. This document is a proposal about legitimate decision-making on Solid between all the parties working on Solid. 

# Scope
At the moment the scope of this document is for changes to the Solid specification. Decisions around the Solid Specification changes need to have a procedure around them to encourage conversation to find accepted legitimate solutions to more complex decisions. 

There are other decisions that may be possible to think about, for example: 
* How to start a [Solid Project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) i.e. a GitHub project in the Solid Github account? 
* What to include on the [Solid roadmap](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-roadmap.md)? 
* Which communication channels to use for Solid conversations? 
* What to include in the Solid test suite? 

# [The Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md)

## Role 
The Solid Team is a trusted group who manage Solid. They assume [defined roles](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md) required to achieve the Solid project's goals, especially those that require a high level of trust. The specific [defined roles](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md) in the Solid team can be edited by anyone through a Github pull request and need to be approved by the Solid Leader.

They make decisions that shape the future of the project. The Solid Team are expected to act as role models for the community and custodians of the project, on behalf of the community and all those who rely on Solid. The Solid Team will interveve where neccessary, in online conversations or at official Solid Events on the rare occasions that a situation arises that requires intervention. They have authority over Solid Project infrastructure, including the Solid Github organisation and repositories, the bug tracker, mailing lists, conversation channels etc.  

The Solid Team is responsible for: 
* Coordinating the definition of the Solid values
* Coordinating the definition of the Solid specifications including from technical, legal, and design perspectives
* Providing examples of the Solid specification under open source licensing
* Promoting awareness of Solid
* Coordinating the several parties implementing the Solid specification 
* Coordinating the development of a Solid Test suite to automate the checking of compliance of solutions to the Solid specifications
* Providing an updated list of Solid solutions

## Requirements 
Solid team members need to demonstrate:
* a good grasp of the philosophy of the Solid Project
* a solid track record of being constructive and helpful
* significant contributions to Solid project's goals, in any form
* willingness to dedicate some time to improving Solid

## Apppoinment
Anyone can apply to a Solid Team role. The Solid Leader appointments candidates to roles.

# The Solid Decision Panel 

## Criteria 
Possible candidates for the Decision Panel, that could be adapted according to the type of decision include: 
* [Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md)
* [MIT Solid Project Team](https://solid.mit.edu) 
* [W3C Solid Community Group Participants](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/participants)

The W3C Solid Community Group is open to anyone although there is an application process that may need to be taken into consideration. Potentially it could be wise to make the criteria more specific that the W3C Solid COmmunity Group Participants, for example: 
* Active Identity Providers   
* Active Pod providers 
* Active Solid app providers 
* Active Solid Users

Once there is a Solid Test Suite it could be made a requirement that identity providers, Pod providers, and Solid app providers need to pass the Solid Test Suite to be able to participate in the Solid Decision Panel. 

Also, you could have a minimum engagement from Solid users, for example: has a WebID, has  Pod, uses a Solid app regularly and actively. 

# Changes to the Solid Specification

## Step 1. Making a Suggestion 
Anyone can suggest a change to the Solid specification by getting a GitHub account and submitting a pull request or issues to the Solid specification repositories. 

## Step 2. Inviting a Conversation around your Suggestion to Find Consensus
You will then need to get a W3C account and join the W3C Solid Community Group to raise a conversation about your suggestion as an item on the weekly call agenda. By adding the item to the agenda all members of the W3C Solid Community Group will be automatically notified and therefore are able to comment on the pull request or issue directly. 

Anyone can suggest routes forward to the suggested changes with pros and cons of each route forward on the original pull request or issues. Below is a table format where all the final suggested routes forward, pros and cons should be included. 

| Route Forward | Pros to Consider | Cons to Consider |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (insert suggestion)  | (insert suggestion)  | (insert suggestion)  |

This step is to make sure that everyone has a chance to voice their thoughts on all the options and their opinions of each so that they feel that all the options are given a chance.

## Step 3. Coming to a Conclusion through Compromise  
The Solid Manager would collect the options, pros, and cons, and then make sure that everyone on the Decision Panel receives a complete copy of all the information via the github pull request and issue.

Each individual in the Decision Panel has one vote even if they have multiple criteria for being in the Decision panel, so each person in the Decision Panel has an equal voice. Each individual can vote on a first and second choice, or they can abstain. After counting the first choice votes, the votes from the bottom three options get transferred to the second choice vote to avoid strategic voting that does not reflect the true opinion of the Decision Panel. The votes are recounted and the majority vote wins. The Solid Manager's responsibilities are to -- 
* make sure everyone on the Decision Panel is aware of the vote
* explain how they can vote
* collect the final results
* communicate the outcome

# History 

The Solid project was started by Tim Berners-Lee, who serves as Benevolent Disctator for Life (BDFL) from inception. If there is a difference of opinion, parties are encouraged to talk to find a compromise. The Solid Specification Repository Manager is responsible for processing the suggestion to a change to the Solid specifications and deciding on the route forward. The repository manager of the repository to which the suggestion pertains to will be responsible for merging and closing the pull request or issue.  If a compromise cannot be met the Solid Leader will make the final judgement.
