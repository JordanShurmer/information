Here is the start of a description of the decision making process for the variety of decision types. Deciding how to decide is a work in progress that is being refined. 

The Solid Leader needs to give final approval the decision making process for each category of decision including who can decide on what to the decision to hold legitimacy. 

Some decisions can be made purely by the Solid Leader; however, there are many decisions at a lower category of important for which it would be useful to have a legitimate process that could always be blocked by the Solid leader. The operations of legitimate process could be [...?]

Types of decisions include: 
* Who is on the Solid team? 
* How to make a change to the Solid spec? 
* How to start a Solid Project? 
 
Possible candidates for the Decision Panel, that could be adapted according to the type of decision include: 
* [Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md)
* [MIT Solid Project Team](https://solid.mit.edu) 
* [W3C Solid Community Group Participants](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/participants)

For the specific decision at hand, the Decision Panel could start by making a list of all the options to move forward with the pros and cons of each option. This is to make sure that everyone has a chance to voice their thoughts on all the options and their opinions of each so that they feel that all the options are given a chance. The Solid Manager would collect the options, pros, and cons, and then make sure that everyone on the Decision Panel receives a complete copy of all the information. 

Each individual in the Decision Panel has one vote even if they have multiple criteria for being in the Decision panel, so each person in the Decision Panel has an equal voice. Each individual can vote on a first and second choice, or they can abstain. After counting the first choice votes, the votes from the bottom three options get transferred to the second choice vote to avoid strategic voting that does not reflect the true opinion of the Decision Panel. The votes are recounted and the majority vote wins. The Solid Manager's responsibilities are to -- 
* make sure everyone on the Decision Panel is aware of the vote
* explain how they can vote
* collect the final results
* communicate the outcome

# Changes to the Solid Specification 
Decisions around the Solid Specification changes need to have a procedure around them to encourage conversation to find solutions to more complex decisions. 

## Step 1. Making a Suggestion 
Anyone can suggest a change to the Solid specification by getting a GitHub account and submitting a pull request or issues to the Solid specification repositories. 

## Step 2. Inviting a Conversation around your Suggestion to Find Consensus
You will then need to get a W3C account and join the W3C Solid Community Group to raise a conversation about your suggestion as an item on the weekly call agenda. By adding the item to the agenda all members of the W3C Solid Community Group will be automatically notified and therefore are able to comment on the pull request or issue directly. 

## Step 3. Coming to a Conclusion through Compromise  
If there is a difference of opinion, parties are encouraged to talk to find a compromise. The Solid Specification Repository Manager is responsible for processing the suggestion to a change to the Solid specifications and deciding on the route forward. The repository manager of the repository to which the suggestion pertains to will be responsible for merging and closing the pull request or issue.  If a compromise cannot be met the Solid Leader will make the final judgement.
