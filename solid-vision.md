# Solid Values

Solid is an open-source project to restore the power and agency of individuals on the web. 

**In Solid, decisions around personal data should be made by the person (Self-determination)**

Solid believes that decisions around how to share what personal data with who should be decided by the person. 

Solid uses the General Data Protection Regulation Article 4(1) definition of ‘personal data’: 

“‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;”

Personal data is an extension of the self, and therefore deserves protection from invasions of
privacy, sovereignty, and freedom.

Previously, internet technology could be seen as a product which "if you don't like it, don't use it".
Nowadays, we have to consider it as infrastructure which every human deserves access to, a bit
like roads and hospitals.

However, internet technology emerges from capitalist processes which sometimes leads to the invasions
of personal data rights mentioned above. Important initiatives to improve this situation take on
different forms: journalism/activism to raise awareness (like EFF or ToS;DR), legislation (like GDPR), and
project that aim to build better internet technology (like Mozilla or Unhosted).

Data is considered an extension of self. People and legal entities should be given the tools for self-determination. Self-determination involves the app user controlling data generated as a result of using an application, rather than the developer or owner of the application. Data control includes deciding where the data is stored as well as who sees what data, for what purpose, when. No individual should make a decision on behalf of another individual without consultation and ensuring that the individually is equipped with the necessary information to make an informed decision on the matter at hand that does not take advantage of convenience nudging. An individual or legal entity should be able to connect data they control to the data others control.

**In Solid, tools are interoperable (Interoperability)**

In Solid, data is separate from applications

Data should be interoperable to ensure that individuals or legal entities are able to self-determine independently of the technical possibilities. Technical hurdles should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability. There should be equal access to the web by all individuals both for consumption and creation. Although, for example, development, may take education, this education should be freely available and accessible by all. It should be easy to find the source of a piece of data so that one can judge the trustworthiness of the data.

When an application is used and data is generated, that data is independently stored from the application in the format described by the Solid spec. Uniform data formats mean that data can be transferred and reused as well as combined i.e. interoperability. 

Everyone should be able to use Solid in a way that works for them and shouldn’t be subject to doctrine, dictation or directive.

In practice: creating applications that are customisable and allow users to make their own.

Solid should be indiscriminate in the way it operates and speak to everyone equally.

In practice: experiences, communications and content that are engineered to be as accessible as possible.

**In Solid, data of people below the age of 18 have default sharing settings (Data Protection)** 

To exist, a person shares data. Therefore, in the same sense that it is questionable if it is possible to get consent to breath a particular air, consent around data is questionable. 

Commonly the first data a person generated is the ultrasound of the baby’s mother.

In Solid there is are default data sharing settings until a person turns 18. The default settings are defined as the minimum required to share to access the UN Human Rights while maximising data protection. 

Distinguish private and public data as well as if it was generated as a deliberate or accidental expression. 

When relating Solid to GDPR, the WebID is the identifier of the data subject, the Pod provider is a data controller, and the Solid app is a data processor.

Long-term public interest should always be given priority over short-term private interest.

In practice: applications and engagement with long-term value to everyone, no matter what their background, experience or understanding.

**(Linked Data)**

Solid applications, events and communications should look to aid or promote connectivity in every aspect.

In practice: a focus on functionality, action and information which helps link people and organisations together more effectively.

It should be easy to find the source of anything associated with Solid so that anyone can judge its trustworthiness.

In practice: pro-active transparency in everything - where information comes from, who created what and how it was created.
