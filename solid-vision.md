# Solid Vision 

Solid (derived from "social linked data") aims to
* make it possible for users online to switch between online services and bring the data generated while using the services along with thm. The Solid specification does not define the user or which user should control what data. 
* decentralise power on the web to ensure that the web is used for the global public interest by providing the Solid specification based on Linked Data principles. 
* bringing personal web data under control of the person, and enabling decentralized apps to access that data when you want them to. It exists because current social/personal web apps do not view user's data as belonging to the user, and do not share that data among themselves.
* is a smarter and decentralised internet with true data ownership as well as improved privacy
* empower people and foster innovation by freeing data from silos
* The long term vision being to provide a home on the web for people who want to manage their own data, with an ever growing ecosystem of apps built to interact with that data.
* This will be accomplished by leveraging the power of linked data to represent data about people and things, WebIDs to associate people with their data, and Web Access Control to provide mechanisms for people to manage access to their data.
* The thing currently called "data browser" will be crucial to the whole thing by enabling the users to fully view and manage all of their data. If user's don't understand how to manage their data (including who/what they're sharing pieces of data with) then it fails
* empower people and foster innovation by freeing data from silos.
* restore the power and agency of individuals on the web
* Data is stored in pods, independently of the services that use this data, thereby offering independent choice of data storage and apps.

* “and who is allowed to access it (data)” - solid.mit.edu
* “avoid vendor lock-in” - solid.mit.edu
* “Users should have the freedom to choose where their data resides” - solid.mit.edu
* “true data control ownership” - solid.mit.edu

"Solid changes the current model where users have to hand over personal data to digital giants in exchange for perceived value."
* "Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance — by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way."
* "It (Solid) gives every user a choice about where data is stored, which specific people and groups can access select elements, and which apps you use."
* "It (Solid) allows you, your family and colleagues, to link and share data with anyone. It allows people to look at the same data with different apps at the same time."
* "Solid is guided by the principle of “personal empowerment through data” which we believe is fundamental to the success of the next era of the web. We believe data should empower each of us."
* "With Solid, you will have far more personal agency over data — you decide which apps can access it."
* "read-write"
* "People want apps that help them do what they want and need to do — without spying on them. Apps that don’t have an ulterior motive of distracting them with propositions to buy this or that. People will pay for this kind of quality and assurance. For example, today people pay for storage in places like Dropbox. There is a need for Solid, and the different, beneficial approach it will provide."

# Solid Mission 

Solid is: 
* a technical specification describing how to build software
* an open-source project
* an open ecosystem of people, data, and services. 
* a collection of tools for the industry and community to realise the vision
* enabling people from all fields to participate with meetups, workshops, lectures and communicate online.
* provide a good use experience solution to non technical people to manage their Linked Data
* provide a smarter decentralized internet with Linked Data and true data ownership 
* creates tools and libraries so the developer community can be able to participate in creating this smarter internet. 
* Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is leading this Misson through the Solid organisation with support from inrupt, one of the first startups within this field. Solid and inrupt are today collaborating in developing a SDK, Design System, Libraries etc. and also a new Data Browser that will be able to use also by non technical people.

# Solid Values 

* accessibility
* honesty/transparency
* share-ability
* privacy
* decentralization
* users own the data
* We are skilled and humble
* We are passionate in what we do
* We believe in a smarter and decentralized internet with real privacy
* We share because we care, open source and standars is in our spirit
* Solid should NEVER assume it controls user's data.
* Solid should NEVER intentionally exclude people from using Solid.
* Solid should ALWAYS allow users to view and manage all their data.
* Solid should ALWAYS encourage web developers to use their user's solid data rather than collect their own data.
* Why Should you use Solid? If I could use various web apps (calendar, recipes, tasks, photos, blog, etc.) which all talk to the same data source, which is under my control and shareable, I would use it. My primary use case that I'm thinking about right now is my family - coordinating our calendars, sharing stories/pictures, meal planning, etc.
* Our data today is locked behind firewalls on popular communities and applications, we have no control of how our data is used and where. The data of the internet today is actually more or less dumb, it has no relation of other data that could be relevant.
* Why does it exist? To level the playing field, such that innovation no longer depends on data harvesting, thereby positively impacting people and creators alike.
* universality
* permissionless innovation
* interoperability
* Choice!
* Solid should never lose sight of what people (end users, developers, inventors…) need.
* Solid should always prioritize choice, while carefully balancing it with interoperability.
* Self-Determination **In Solid, decisions around personal data should be made by the person**

Solid believes that decisions about personal data should be made by the person that the personal data describes. 

Solid uses the General Data Protection Regulation Article 4(1) definition of ‘personal data’: 
“‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;”

Personal data can be in the public or the private domain (or somewhere in between). Personal data can be generated very deliberately such as when writing a message to someone or through accidental expression as an unintented consequence of using an online tool. 

Self-determination involves the app user making decisions about the data generated as a result of using an application, rather than the developer or owner of the application. Decisions around personal data include where data should be stored and who should have access to what data when and for what purpose. How a person identifies themselves online is defined by Solid. 

No one should make a decision around personal data on behalf of another person without in depth consultation. App developers are responsible for ensuring that the app user is equipped with the necessary information to make informed decisions and should be very careful to not manipulate the app users decisions. 

* Interoperability **In Solid, it should be possible for everyone to use online tools and to be able to switch between tools if they change their mind**

When Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the web, it was intended for everyone. Solid reaffirms the intention by making it possible for anyone to participate regardless of which app they choose to use. 

In Solid, data is separate from applications and data can move seemlessly from one application to another application with uniform data formats described by the Solid specification. 

Different apps have different value sets, for example around privacy, which are infused into the app design. Solid app users can easily switch between Solid apps and bring the data generated while using Solid apps with them. Bringing personal data from old Solid apps used to new Solid apps used means that the functionality is maintained and the user doesn't have to compromise their values when choosing which tools to use.  

Unnecessary technical hurdles or business opportunities should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability. 

There should be equal access to the web by all individuals both for consumption and creation. Although, for example, development, may take education, this education should be freely available and accessible by all. It should be easy to find the source of a piece of data so that one can judge the trustworthiness of the data. Everyone should be able to use Solid in a way that works for them and shouldn’t be subject to doctrine, dictation or directive. Solid should be indiscriminate in the way it operates and speak to everyone equally.

In Solid, users are free to move between apps without interruption of service while avoiding vendor lock-in. 

* Data Protection **In Happy Solid, only essential apps are listed and the default settings of these apps are so that the minimum amount of data needed to obtain access to human rights is shared in conditions that maximise data protection** 

When personal data is considered as as extension of the person past frameworks of understandings around how people should interact such as the Declaration of Human Rights become easier to apply. 

Commonly the first data a person generates is the ultrasound of the baby’s mother. To exist, a person shares data. Therefore, in the same sense that it is questionable if it is possible to get consent to breath a particular air, consent around data is questionable. Similar to the offline, contract law around online consent should not overule other more substantial legal and social agreements. 

Previously, web technology could be seen as an optional product which "if you don't like it, don't use it".
Nowadays, one has to consider it as infrastructure which every human deserves access to, a bit like roads and hospitals.

Values such as privacy and sovereignty are core to Solid. The default settings of Solid apps should follow the priciples of data minimisation i.e. the minimum data to carry out the app functionality should be collected. 

When relating Solid to GDPR, the 'WebID' is the identifier of the data subject, the Pod provider is a data controller, and the Solid app is a data processor. 

In Solid there is are default data sharing settings until a person turns 18. The default settings are defined as the minimum required to share to access the UN Human Rights while maximising data protection (Happy Solid?).
