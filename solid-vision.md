# What is Solid? 

Solid is a voluntary technical specification describing how to build interoperable software. 

Solid is originally derived from ‘social linked data’ and is led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web. 

1.	Login: Solid users identify themselves with a WebID which is domain name based. Ideally the user owns the domain used to identify themselves. 
2.	Pods: Solid users store their data on Pods. Each Solid each can have multiple Pods. Data generated while using Solid apps is stored on the Pod independently of the app. 
3.	Apps: Solid apps get granular access to user data meaning they get a specific type of data, for a specific purpose, for a set timeframe, etc. 

# Solid Mission 

Solid’s mission is to make it possible for users online to move seamlessly from applications or data storage providers (‘Pods’) without interruption of service and take the data generated while using the previous application or Pod along with them. Solid does not define the user which could be anything from a person, to a company, to a government. Solid also does not define which data should be controlled by which user.

# Solid Vision 

Solid’s vision is to make it possible for users online to have many options about how to use the Web. 

# Solid Values 

* Interoperability: 

Solid apps and Pods should be completely understood by other Solid apps and Pods, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions. In Solid, data should be reusable and recyclable.  

Data should slot seamlessly from one Solid app or Pod to another without permission from each other. Solid app and Pod providers should be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all while reusing existing data that was created by other apps. 

Unnecessary technical hurdles or business opportunities should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability.  

* Digital Sovereignty: 

Users online should be able to self determine around granular data related decisions such as where each piece of data is stored, how it is used, by who, and for how long. 

Granularity of the decisions as well as being presented with multiple options is important for that self determination to be valid. 

Users should be able to use Solid in a way that works for them and shouldn’t be subject to doctrine, dictation or directive.

* Accessibility, Openness and Universality

Using and developing the web should be available to all and shareable. There should be equal access to the web by all individuals both for consumption and creation i.e. the read-write web. 

Although, for example, development, may take education, this education should be freely available and accessible by all. 

The web should be available everywhere and should be indiscriminate in the way it operates and speak to everyone equally.
