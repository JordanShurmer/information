# What is Solid? 

Solid is a voluntary technical specification describing how to build software. Solid is originally derived from ‘social linked data’ and is led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web. 

# Solid Mission 

Solid’s mission is to make it possible for users online to move seamlessly from applications or data storage providers (Pods) without interruption of service and take the data generated while using the previous application or Pod along with them. Solid does not define the user which could be anything from a person, to a company, to a government. Solid also does not define which data should be controlled by which user.

# Solid Vision 

Solid’s vision is to make it possible for users online to have many options about how to use the Web. 

# Solid Values 

•	*Permissionless innovation*: it should be possible for any engineer to build code without asking for permission from another engineer. Fair market? Non-monopolistic? Unnecessary technical hurdles or business opportunities should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability. 
•	*Interoperability*: a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions. * Interoperability. In Solid, it should be possible for everyone to use online tools and to be able to switch between tools if they change their mind. 
•	*Accessibility*: using and developing the web should be available to all and shareable. There should be equal access to the web by all individuals both for consumption and creation. Although, for example, development, may take education, this education should be freely available and accessible by all. It should be easy to find the source of a piece of data so that one can judge the trustworthiness of the data. Everyone should be able to use Solid in a way that works for them and shouldn’t be subject to doctrine, dictation or directive. Solid should be indiscriminate in the way it operates and speak to everyone equally.
•	*Universality*: being available everywhere
•	*Openness*: in code and standards
•	*Options*: there should be multiple options of each of the components of the web for users to select from
•	*Reusability*: it should be possible to reuse and recycle data
