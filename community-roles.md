Each test will take approximately 30 minutes, Solid Panelists are not obliged to participate in all tests, and Solid Panelists can stop being on the Solid Panel at any point. Tests will be designed to improve the Solid experience.

Advisory board members will be appointed by the Community Leader with the support of the Community Manager. The advisory board will take part in several workshops to discuss the governance issues together. The community manager will be coordinating the workshops.
