If you want to make Solid applications, or get a better understanding for what's under the hood in Solid, you've come to the right place. These materials will continue to be a work in progress as the Solid ecosystem grows and expands, so please let us know if you can’t find what you’re looking for. We’ll do our best to get it added (and help you in the process). 

[Make a Solid app on your lunch break.](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/apps.md)

Get your first decentralized Solid app working in the time it takes to find and finish a box of spring rolls. You’ll still want to come back and learn the fundamentals, but you’ll be surprised how quickly you can get something up and working without them. 

# Learning the Basics

To really have fun making Solid applications, you’ll want to understand some of the fundamental concepts of the Solid specification, as well as the basics of Linked Data. The data model is built around Linked Data, and it drives the most powerful aspects of Solid.

Here's where to start:

1. Introduction to the Solid Specification
2. [Introduction to Linked Data](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/learning-linked-data.md)
3. Expressing Linked Data with Turtle
4. Manipulating Linked Data

# Are you a future developer?

A lot of people started creating the Web without any programming background, and in the future, this is what we aim at doing for the new Web. The perspective you and your friends have matters, and you should be able to make that practical on Solid. There’s a lot of work on us to get there, but follow this space, we’ll get there together.
