# Solid Values

* **Interoperability**: Data should be interoperable to ensure that individuals or legal entities are able to self-determine independently of the technical possibilities. Technical hurdles should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability.

* **Equal Access**: There should be equal access to the web by all individuals both for consumption and creation. Although, for example, development, may take education, this education should be freely available and accessible by all.

* **Sourcing**: It should be easy to find the source of a piece of data so that one can judge the trustworthiness of the data.

* **Data as an extension of self**: 

* **Self Determination**: People and legal entities should be given the tools for self-determination. Self-determination involves the app user controlling data generated as a result of using an application, rather than the developer or owner of the application. Data control includes deciding where the data is stored as well as who sees what data, for what purpose, when. No individual should make a decision on behalf of another individual without consultation and ensuring that the individually is equipped with the necessary information to make an informed decision on the matter at hand that does not take advantage of convenience nudging. An individual or legal entity should be able to connect data they control to the data others control.
