# Solid Values

**Interoperability**
-
Data should be interoperable to ensure that individuals or legal entities are able to self-determine independently of the technical possibilities. Technical hurdles should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability. There should be equal access to the web by all individuals both for consumption and creation. Although, for example, development, may take education, this education should be freely available and accessible by all. It should be easy to find the source of a piece of data so that one can judge the trustworthiness of the data.

Self-determination
-
Everyone should be able to use Solid in a way that works for them and shouldnâ€™t be subject to doctrine, dictation or directive.

In practice: creating applications that are customisable and allow users to make their own.

Data is considered an extension of self. People and legal entities should be given the tools for self-determination. Self-determination involves the app user controlling data generated as a result of using an application, rather than the developer or owner of the application. Data control includes deciding where the data is stored as well as who sees what data, for what purpose, when. No individual should make a decision on behalf of another individual without consultation and ensuring that the individually is equipped with the necessary information to make an informed decision on the matter at hand that does not take advantage of convenience nudging. An individual or legal entity should be able to connect data they control to the data others control.

Equal access
-
Solid should be indiscriminate in the way it operates and speak to everyone equally.

In practice: experiences, communications and content that are engineered to be as accessible as possible.

Sourcing
-
It should be easy to find the source of anything associated with Solid so that anyone can judge its trustworthiness.

In practice: pro-active transparency in everything - where information comes from, who created what and how it was created.

Public Value
-
Long-term public interest should always be given priority over short-term private interest.

In practice: applications and engagement with long-term value to everyone, no matter what their background, experience or understanding.

Connecting
-
Solid applications, events and communications should look to aid or promote connectivity in every aspect.

In practice: a focus on functionality, action and information which helps link people and organisations together more effectively.
